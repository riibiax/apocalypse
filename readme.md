«Apocalypse Head» is a key box, who hides a mini-computer Raspberry Pi equipped by a light sensor.

This ordinary object uses a hacking code to intepretare the (natural and artificial) light and to spam autonomously on the social network Flickr.

According to the light intensity, it searches for pictures that were taken in the same day time (using meta-data) and it posts sentences from the book of Apocalypse.

The designed artifact (and subsequent use) causes reflection on existing values, mores, and practices in a culture.

The paradox is that the Flickr’s comunity considers this web-bot user as a real human user.
